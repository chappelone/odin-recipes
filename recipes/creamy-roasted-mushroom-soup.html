        <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, <em>to taste</em></li>
        <li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 large sweet onion, <em>diced</em></li>
        <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/3 cup dry white wine</li>

        <li>2 bay leaves</li>
        <li>1/3 cup heavy cream</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Place mushrooms in a single layer onto the prepared baking sheet. Add olive oil, half of the garlic and 4 sprigs thyme; season with salt and pepper, to taste. Gently toss to combine.</li>
        <li>Place into oven and bake for 20-30 minutes, or until browned and tender, stirring once. Let cool before coarsely chopping; set aside.</li>
        <li>Melt butter in a large stockpot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add onion, and cook, stirring constantly, until golden and caramelized, about 10-15 minutes. Stir in remaining garlic until fragrant, about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Whisk in flour until lightly browned, about 1 minute. Stir in wine, scraping any browned bits from the bottom of the pot.</li>
        <li>Stir in chicken stock, bay leaves and remaining thyme; season with salt and pepper, to taste. Bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer until slightly reduced, about 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in mushrooms; simmer until thickened, about 10-15 additional minutes. Remove from heat; stir in heavy cream.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately.</li>
